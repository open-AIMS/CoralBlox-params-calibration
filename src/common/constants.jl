"""
Central named constants for model dimensions and parameter bounds.

This file must be included before any file that references these constants
(see `common.jl` / `plot.jl` include order). Values mirror the literals
previously hardcoded across `cover_construction.jl`, `param_bounds.jl`,
`plotting.jl`, and the numbered pipeline scripts — no numeric value should be
changed here without re-deriving every dependent reshape/index.

# ADRIA defaults all sit at CV 0.774). The high end is degenerate: a tolerance distribution
# that wide, truncated to [HEAT_LB, mean+HEAT_UB], is nearly flat, making bleaching almost
# insensitive to DHW. Holding std to +/-25% narrows the span to 0.39-1.94, removing the
