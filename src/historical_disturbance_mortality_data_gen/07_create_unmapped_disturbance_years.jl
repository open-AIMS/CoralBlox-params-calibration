# Writes data/unmapped_disturbance_years.csv: every ReefMonitoring "unknown" ("u") disturbance
# on a target reef that carries NO mortality forcing in the datacube, paired with the survey
# year its impact first shows up in.
#
# NOT currently consumed anywhere - the calibration does not down-weight these observations.
# See https://github.com/open-AIMS/CoralBlox-params-calibration/issues/26 for the proposed
# down-weighting design; this file only identifies the affected (reef, year) cells.
#
# Storms ("s"), COTS ("c") and "multiple" ("m") are deliberately NOT here: they already carry
# forcing via historical_disturbance_mortality_rates.nc. Bleaching ("b") is not here either -
# DHW forcing covers it, so down-weighting bleaching years would penalise the model for a
# disturbance it does see.

using Dates

# Only "u". Disease ("d") is one entry away if it's ever wanted (a single event GBR-wide over
# 2008-2022, so it changes nothing measurable either way).
UNMAPPED_TYPES = ["u"]

# An event this close to a curated row is the same event - the curated `year` column carries
# rounded/annualised dates for non-cyclone disturbances, so exact matching produces false
# "unmapped" hits (verified: Snake Reef's 2021.94 COTS is curated as 2022.0).
